# Practice Field Management System (PFMS)
## What is this?
This is an unofficial, match play only, FIRST Robotics Competition Field Management System, designed for use to just run robots on a practice field.

## Features
- Easy Setup. (No $20,000 equipment roadcase, just a computer, router, and other optional materials)
- Not Expensive. (Just use a $60 router and one regular computer as the server.)
- Easily Configurable. (10 minute autonomous? Why not!);

### Requirements
- One computer with this program on it. (Pretty much any computer laying around will work)
- One computer (can be the same computer) with the [FRC Radio Configuration Utility](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/troubleshooting/l/442032-programming-radios-for-fms-offseason).
- One router that can broadcast WIFI. (Pretty much anything like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-AC1200-Smart-Router-Ethernet/dp/B072Z68KJ4/) or better will work, as long as it supports a 5Ghz network)
- (Optional) One (or more) network switch(s) for connecting the PFMS computer and the driver station computers to the network.

### Inspiration / Resources
- Team 254's [Cheesy Arena](https://github.com/Team254/cheesy-arena/). (Inspiration for this project and resources for how to communicate with driver stations)
- The [WPILib](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/) and [FMS](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/troubleshooting/l/705152-fms-whitepaper) ScreenStepsLive Documentation. (Goals and how networking works.)
