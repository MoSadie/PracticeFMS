# Practice Field Management System (PFMS)
## What is this?
This is an unofficial, match play only, FIRST Robotics Competition Field Management System, designed for use to just run robots on a practice field.

## Features
- Easy Setup. (No $20,000 equipment roadcase, just a computer, router, and other optional materials)
- Not Expensive. (Just use a $60 router and one regular computer as the server.)
- Easily Configurable. (10 minute autonomous? Why not!)

## Documentation
More information, including step by step instructions for setting all of this up, is available at
