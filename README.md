* What is this?
This is an unofficial, match play only, FIRST Robotics Competition Field Management System, designed for use to just run robots on a practice field.

* Features
- Easy Setup (Just type the team numbers after configuring the radios and automatically connected!)
- Not Expensive (Just use a router and one computer as the server.)
- Easily Configurable (10 minute autonomous? Why not!);

** Inspiration / Resources
- Cheesy Arena (Inspiration for this project and resources for how to communicate with driver stations)
- The WPILib/FMS ScreenStepsLive Documentation (How I should mimic the FMS)
